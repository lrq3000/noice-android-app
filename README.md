For a lot of people, a little uniform background noise is helpful to remain calm
and focused. In some cases, it also boosts productivity and lowers the effects
of stress and anxiety. Background noise also masks tinnitus, calms agitated
infants and improves reading and meditation experiences.

Noice for Android allows you to create personalised sound environments. It
enables you to combine different sounds at different volume levels to create
perfect ambient atmospheres. These custom sound surroundings let you drown out
distractions and allow you to concentrate. You can also use it to generate a
serene, peaceful aura that encourages you to relax and fall asleep.

### APKs

You can also download the APKs from the [GitHub Releases][github-releases].  The
`full` APK has non-free dependencies (mostly related to Google Play), while the
`free` variant only uses FOSS dependencies. The `free` variant doesn't support
casting audio from Noice using Chromecast.
